# TrucksProject
Repository for my Microsoft Learn IoT project! In this project I extend the functionality created over the MS Learn course by increasing the number of trucks and relocating to Australia.

# Concept
Initially, I wanted to create a new kind of device to represent warehouses which store products. Warehouses would also be responsible for maintaining the temperature of goods, but would have additional functionality to request supplies from other warehouses if they were running low on stock, or make a request to a remote supplier (which would bring a larger supply, but take longer). Each vehicle would start from a different warehouse. I think this would be a really valuable and interesting addition to the modelling project, but I quickly realised that the knowledge of the IoT pipeline and JavaScript, as well as the ability to quickly model computational problems, required to achieve something like this was beyond my personal abilities. 

Instead, I thought it would be interesting to add some new visualisations, add a few extra trucks, and input new starting locations and destinations. To make the process of running the project easier, I also found out how to run multiple apps without requiring 6 separate command windows for each truck. This was, of course, much more manageable (especially considering that I started this project the day after it was due because the MS Learn course took longer than expected), and easier to achieve results, but I thought it was still a creative response. I hope you enjoy exploring the results I achieved!
